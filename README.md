# SQL-database-for-Italian-takeaway-food-restaurant.

We will be building a SQL database for our Italian takeaway food restaurant.  
Just like most Italian takeaways we will be having a menu, menu item category, dine in tables, order channel etc.
To keep track of the numbers (like seats and orders) we will need to construct a SQL database that will allow us 
to oversee any changes made and manage it easily. Furthermore, the SQL technology nowadays has reached a level where
it can manage inventory /stock regardless of how much information there has to be inputted while maintaining an incredible 
high processing speed.   

It’s in the restaurants best interest to have as many things as possible processed automatically instead of manually for 
maximum efficiency and speed. Managers will also have the ability to oversee the whole process and have the ability to revert 
or make changes such as altering the menu prices with just a few clicks instantly! 

Of course, you always have to be cautious what effect it may have to automate tasks previously done manually,
for example when someone orders alcohol with his order online, the person delivering the food has to ensure the person 
taking the order is over 18. It can cause legal troubles to the company and more importantly harm the restaurants reputation 
if it’s found to have sold alcohol to a young kid. Other things to keep track of is the expiring date on the food in stock and 
to have a person inspect the condition of the food once in a while as serving or sending expired food to a costumer is against the law. 

We can’t ignore the privacy issue that comes with using a database for the company, for example if the information 
of a costumer is stored on to the system we have to ensure that no hacker can possible get his hands on them, and in 
the rare scenario they do we have to immediately inform the costumer on their leaked information.
